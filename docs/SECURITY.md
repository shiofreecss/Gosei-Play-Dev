# Security and Deployment Configuration

This document outlines how sensitive information, deployment configurations, and server details are handled in the Gosei Play project.

## Current Security Status ✅

**Version**: v1.0.8  
**Security Level**: Production-ready with comprehensive protections  
**Last Security Review**: May 26, 2025  
**Compliance**: GDPR-aware, privacy-focused design

## Files Excluded from Version Control

The following files and directories are excluded from version control for security and operational reasons:

### Environment Variables
- `.env`
- `.env.development`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`
- `.env*.local`

These files contain environment-specific configuration, including API endpoints, server URLs, and potentially sensitive tokens.

### Deployment Documentation and Configuration
- `HEROKU_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Contains detailed server setup instructions
- `NETLIFY_SETUP.md` - Contains Netlify deployment details
- `heroku-server/` - Complete server code and configuration
- `netlify-build.sh` - Build script with potential sensitive flags
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify-specific configuration

### SSL/TLS Certificates and Keys
- `**/*.pem`
- `**/*.key`
- `**/*.crt`
- `**/*.cert`

These are cryptographic certificates and private keys that should never be committed to version control.

### Sensitive Configuration Files
- `**/config.prod.ts`
- `**/config.production.ts`
- `**/*.config.prod.js`
- `**/*-secrets.json`
- `**/*_secrets.json`
- `**/*.secret.*`

Files that might contain API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive configuration.

- **Subdomain Protection**: Proper subdomain security configuration

## Data Privacy and Compliance ✅

### Privacy by Design
- **No User Registration**: Play without creating accounts
- **Temporary Sessions**: Game sessions expire automatically
- **No Data Retention**: Game data not permanently stored
- **Anonymous Play**: No tracking of individual players

### GDPR Compliance
- **Minimal Data Processing**: Only necessary data processed
- **Transparent Privacy**: Clear privacy practices documented
- **User Control**: Users control their own data
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: No external analytics or tracking

### Data Handling
- **In-Memory Storage**: Game state stored in memory only
- **No Database**: No persistent user data storage
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- **Secure Transmission**: All data encrypted in transit

## Security Best Practices

### Development Security
1. **Never commit sensitive information** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Sanitize user content** to prevent XSS attacks
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to avoid security vulnerabilities
6. **Use TypeScript** for type safety and error prevention

### Deployment Security
1. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
2. **Enable CORS properly** to restrict unauthorized domains
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Monitor server logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Regular security updates** for all dependencies
6. **Backup and recovery** procedures in place

### Operational Security
1. **Rotate secrets regularly** (API keys, credentials)
2. **Limit access** to deployment platforms
3. **Use secure communication** for sensitive information
4. **Regular security audits** of code and infrastructure
5. **Incident response plan** for security issues
6. **Security training** for all team members
