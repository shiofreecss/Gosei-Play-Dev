# Time Tracking System

## Current Status: v1.0.8 ✅

**Implementation**: Production Ready | **Last Updated**: May 26, 2025

## Overview

Gosei Play implements an advanced move-based time tracking system that provides accurate, fair, and transparent timing for competitive Go games. This system replaces traditional continuous countdown timers with precise move-based time deduction.

## Core Principles

### 1. Move-Based Deduction
Time is only deducted when actual moves or passes are made, not during continuous countdown. This ensures:
- **Accuracy**: Time reflects actual thinking time
- **Fairness**: No time lost to network lag or system delays
- **Transparency**: Clear record of time spent on each move

### 2. Precise Time Calculation
Each move records the exact time spent thinking:
```
Time Spent = Move Time - Turn Start Time
```

### 3. Real-Time Synchronization
All players receive immediate time updates after each move, ensuring consistent game state across all clients.

## System Architecture

### Server-Side Implementation

#### Core Functions
```javascript
// Calculate actual time spent on a move
function calculateMoveTime(gameState) {
  if (!gameState.lastMoveTime) {
    return 0;
  }
  return Math.floor((Date.now() - gameState.lastMoveTime) / 1000);
}

// Format time display consistently
function formatMoveTimeDisplay(timeSpentSeconds) {
  const minutes = Math.floor(timeSpentSeconds / 60);
  const seconds = timeSpentSeconds % 60;
  return `${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${seconds.toString().padStart(2, '0')}s`;
}
```

#### Time Deduction Process
1. **Turn Start**: `gameState.lastMoveTime` is set when a player's turn begins
2. **Move Made**: Calculate time spent using `calculateMoveTime()`
3. **Time Deduction**: Deduct spent time from player's remaining time
4. **State Update**: Update player's time state and broadcast to all clients
5. **Next Turn**: Reset timer for the next player

### Client-Side Integration

The system is fully compatible with existing client-side timer components:
- **GameTimer.js**: Receives accurate time updates from server
- **TimeDisplay.js**: Displays current time state without local countdown
- **TimeControl.tsx**: Manages time control settings and display

## Time Control Types

### Main Time
Standard time allocation for each player:
```javascript
// Deduct from main time
const newMainTime = Math.max(0, movingPlayer.timeRemaining - timeSpentOnMove);
movingPlayer.timeRemaining = newMainTime;

// Check for main time expiration
if (newMainTime <= 0 && gameState.timeControl.byoYomiPeriods > 0) {
  // Transition to byo-yomi
  movingPlayer.isInByoYomi = true;
  movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiPeriods;
  movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
}
```

### Byo-Yomi Periods
Japanese time control system with additional time periods:
```javascript
// Deduct from byo-yomi time
const newByoYomiTime = Math.max(0, movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft - timeSpentOnMove);
movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = newByoYomiTime;

// Check for period expiration
if (newByoYomiTime <= 0 && movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft > 1) {
  // Move to next byo-yomi period
  movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft -= 1;
  movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
}
```

### Blitz Games
Time-per-move format for fast games:
```javascript
// Reset timer for each move
if (gameState.gameType === 'blitz' && gameState.timePerMove) {
  movingPlayer.timeRemaining = gameState.timePerMove;
}
```

## Features

### ✅ Accurate Move Timing
- Each move records exact time spent thinking
- Time displayed in MM:SS format (e.g., "00:15s" for 15 seconds)
- Both moves and passes record time spent

### ✅ Proper Time Deduction
- Time deducted from player's remaining time when moves are made
- Main time decreases based on actual time spent
- Byo-yomi periods consumed based on actual usage

### ✅ Automatic Transitions
- Seamless transition from main time to byo-yomi when main time expires
- Automatic progression through byo-yomi periods
- Clear logging of all time state changes

### ✅ Real-Time Updates
- All clients receive immediate time updates after each move
- Consistent time state across all connected clients
- Enhanced logging for debugging and monitoring

## Logging and Monitoring

### Move Tracking
```
🎯 MOVE TRACKED - Player made move at (4, 4) - Time spent: 00:10s (Main)
⏰ TIME DEDUCTED - Player black spent 10s from main time, 110s remaining
📤 TIME UPDATE SENT - Player black: Main=110s, InByoYomi=false
```

### Byo-Yomi Transitions
```
🚨 ENTERING BYO-YOMI: Player black entered byo-yomi with 5 periods
⏳ BYO-YOMI PERIOD USED: Player black used one period, 4 periods remaining
```

### Pass Tracking
```
🎯 PASS TRACKED - Player passed - Time spent: 00:05s (Byo-yomi)
⏰ TIME DEDUCTED (PASS) - Player white spent 5s in byo-yomi, 35s remaining in period
```

## Benefits

### 🎯 Accuracy
- Time tracking matches actual thinking time
- No timer drift or synchronization issues
- Precise byo-yomi period management

### 🚀 Performance
- Reduced server load (no continuous timer updates)
- More efficient network usage
- Better scalability for multiple games

### 🎮 User Experience
- Clear feedback on time spent per move
- Accurate time remaining displays
- Proper byo-yomi transitions

### 🔧 Maintainability

## Configuration

### Time Control Settings
```javascript
// Standard time control
{
  timeControl: 120,        // 2 minutes main time
  byoYomiPeriods: 5,       // 5 byo-yomi periods
  byoYomiTime: 40          // 40 seconds per period
}

// Blitz time control
{
  gameType: 'blitz',
  timePerMove: 30          // 30 seconds per move
}
```

### Game State Structure
```javascript
{
  lastMoveTime: 1640995200000,  // Timestamp when current turn started
  players: [
    {
      id: "player1",
      color: "black",
      timeRemaining: 120,         // Main time remaining (seconds)
      isInByoYomi: false,         // Whether in byo-yomi mode
      byoYomiPeriodsLeft: 5,      // Byo-yomi periods remaining
      byoYomiTimeLeft: 40         // Time left in current period
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
- ✅ Various time control settings (2 minutes + 5×40s byo-yomi)
- ✅ Main time to byo-yomi transitions
- ✅ Multiple byo-yomi period consumption
- ✅ Both moves and passes
- ✅ Multiple concurrent games
- ✅ Network disconnection and reconnection
- ✅ Game state synchronization

### Performance Testing
- ✅ Multiple simultaneous games (10+ concurrent)
- ✅ Long games with many moves (200+ moves)
- ✅ Rapid move sequences (blitz games)
- ✅ Memory usage and cleanup

## Migration and Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing games continue to work
- No client-side changes required
- Existing time control settings preserved
- Compatible with all board sizes and game types

### Migration Process
1. Server automatically uses new time tracking for new games
2. Existing games maintain their current timer behavior
3. No database migrations required
4. Gradual rollout possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Time Not Deducting
- **Cause**: `gameState.lastMoveTime` not set
- **Solution**: Ensure timer is reset when turns change
- **Debug**: Check server logs for "TIMER CALCULATION" messages

#### Incorrect Time Display
- **Cause**: Client-server synchronization issue
- **Solution**: Force time update broadcast
- **Debug**: Check "TIME UPDATE SENT" logs

#### Byo-Yomi Not Triggering
- **Cause**: Time control configuration missing
- **Solution**: Verify `byoYomiPeriods > 0` in game settings
- **Debug**: Check "ENTERING BYO-YOMI" logs

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// Server-side debugging
console.log('Game state:', JSON.stringify(gameState, null, 2));
console.log('Player times:', gameState.players.map(p => ({
  color: p.color,
  main: p.timeRemaining,
  byoyomi: p.byoYomiTimeLeft,
  periods: p.byoYomiPeriodsLeft
})));
```

## Future Enhancements
