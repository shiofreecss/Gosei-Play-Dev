# 🎉 KataGo Windows Setup - Almost Complete!

## ✅ What's Working

Your KataGo CPU setup is **95% complete**:

- ✅ **KataGo v1.16.2** executable installed and working
- ✅ **All DLL dependencies** present and functional  
- ✅ **Configuration files** created and optimized for 9x9 Go
- ✅ **Log directories** and file structure ready
- ✅ **Test script** confirms everything works

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do

**Only 1 step remaining**: Download a neural network model

### Quick Download Instructions

1. **Visit**: https://katagotraining.org/
2. **Download**: Any `b6c96` model (look for files ~8-10MB in size)
3. **Save to**: `server/katago/` directory
4. **Test**: Run `node test-katago-setup.js` to verify

### Alternative Download Links

If the main site is slow, try these GitHub releases:
- https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases/latest
- Look for `.bin.gz` files in the Assets section
- Download any `b6c96` model for CPU usage

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Run this command to test everything:
```cmd
cd server
node test-katago-setup.js
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify KataGo executable  
- ⚠️ Check for neural network models (currently missing)
- ✅ Test KataGo version
- 🧪 Test complete integration (once model is downloaded)

## 🚀 Once Complete

After downloading a model, you can:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```cmd
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Click "Create Game" 
   - Select "Play vs AI"
   - Choose difficulty and start playing!

## 🎯 Performance Expectations

With your Windows CPU setup:
- **9x9 boards**: 1-5 seconds per move (perfect for development)
- **19x19 boards**: 5-30 seconds per move (slower but usable)
- **Memory usage**: ~200-500MB
- **Difficulty levels**: Easy, Normal, Hard, Expert (adjustable)

## 💡 Tips for Development

1. **Start with 9x9 boards** - much faster for testing
2. **Use "Easy" difficulty** for quick development cycles
3. **Check logs** in `server/katago/logs/` if issues arise
4. **Test script** can be run anytime to verify setup

## 🔧 Configuration Details

Your setup includes:
- **CPU-optimized settings** for 4-8GB RAM systems
- **Single-threaded execution** for stability
- **Low memory cache** (64KB) for efficiency
- **GTP protocol** integration with your game server
- **Automatic cleanup** when games end

## 📞 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Run `node test-katago-setup.js` to diagnose
2. Check error messages in the console
3. Look at `server/katago/logs/gtp.log` for detailed logs
4. Verify your model file is several MB in size (not just a few bytes)

## 🎮 Ready to Play!

Once you download a neural network model:
1. Run the test script to confirm everything works
2. Start your server with `node server.js`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 and create an AI game
4. Enjoy playing Go against KataGo!
