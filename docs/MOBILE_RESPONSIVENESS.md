# Mobile and Tablet Responsiveness

This document outlines the responsive design approach used in the Gosei Play application, including device detection and specific optimizations for different screen sizes.

## Current Implementation Status ✅

**Version**: v1.0.8  
**Mobile Support**: Fully responsive design with optimized touch interfaces  
**Device Coverage**: Mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers  
**Framework**: Tailwind CSS with custom responsive utilities

## Device Detection

The application uses a custom hook `useDeviceDetect` to determine the current device type based on screen width. This hook is located in `src/hooks/useDeviceDetect.ts`.

### Breakpoints

The application uses the following breakpoints for device detection:

- **Mobile**: < 768px (< md breakpoint)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (md to lg breakpoint)  
- **Desktop**: ≥ 1024px (≥ lg breakpoint)

### Usage

```typescript
import useDeviceDetect from '../../hooks/useDeviceDetect';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useDeviceDetect();
  
  return (
    <div className={`
      ${isMobile ? 'mobile-styles' : ''}
      ${isTablet ? 'tablet-styles' : ''}
      ${isDesktop ? 'desktop-styles' : ''}
    `}>
      {/* Your component content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Responsive Design Principles

### Mobile View (< 768px)
- **Full-width layouts** for maximum screen utilization
- **Smaller text sizes** optimized for mobile reading
- **Compact controls** with touch-friendly spacing
- **Touch-friendly button sizes** (minimum 44x44px)
- **Stacked layouts** for better readability
- **Optimized board sizes** (9×9 and 13×13 recommended)

### Tablet View (768px - 1024px)
- **Optimized 600px width** for game info components
- **Larger text sizes** for better readability
- **Increased padding and spacing** for comfortable touch interaction
- **Enhanced touch targets** with adequate spacing
- **Balanced layouts** between mobile and desktop approaches
- **All board sizes supported** with good visibility

### Desktop View (≥ 1024px)
- **Sidebar layouts** for efficient information display
- **Standard text sizes** for optimal reading
- **Efficient use of screen real estate**
- **Hover states** for interactive elements
- **All board sizes fully supported** including 21×21
