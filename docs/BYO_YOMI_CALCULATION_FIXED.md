# Byo-Yomi Calculation Logic - CORRECTED ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolution: v1.0.10

**Status**: FIXED | **Date**: December 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Incorrect time calculation logic

## Problem Description

### Previous Incorrect Logic ‚ùå
The original implementation was only checking if a move was made within the current byo-yomi period, but **not calculating the actual periods consumed** based on total time spent.

**Example of Wrong Calculation**:
```javascript
// OLD BROKEN LOGIC
if (timeSpentOnMove <= movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft) {
  // Reset period - WRONG!
} else {
  // Only consume 1 period - WRONG!
  movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft -= 1;
}
```

### Correct Logic Required ‚úÖ
The byo-yomi calculation must properly handle:
1. **Main time deduction**
2. **First-time byo-yomi entry with period consumption**
3. **Subsequent byo-yomi moves with proper period calculation**

## Correct Calculation Formulas

### 1. Main Time Phase
```
Condition: total_spend - remaining_maintime <= 0
Status: Player still in main time period
Action: Deduct time from main time remaining
```

### 2. First Time Entering Byo-Yomi
```
Condition: total_spend - remaining_maintime > 0
Formula: 
  time_overage = total_spend - remaining_maintime
  periods_consumed = floor(time_overage / byoyomi_duration)
  remaining_periods = total_byoyomi_periods - periods_consumed

Example:
  total_byoyomi_periods = 7
  byoyomi_duration = 30s  
  total_spend = 83s
  remaining_maintime = 45s
  
  time_overage = 83 - 45 = 38s (in byo-yomi)
  periods_consumed = floor(38/30) = floor(1.26) = 1
  remaining_periods = 7 - 1 = 6
  
Status: Player in byo-yomi with 6 periods remaining
```

### 3. Subsequent Byo-Yomi Moves

#### 3.1 Move Within Period
```
Condition: total_spend <= byoyomi_duration
Action: Reset byo-yomi clock, keep same period count
Status: Clock resets to full byoyomi_duration, same periods

Example:
  current_periods = 5
  byoyomi_duration = 30s
  total_spend = 10s
  
  10 <= 30 ‚Üí Reset clock to 30s, periods remain 5
```

#### 3.2 Move Exceeds Period(s)
```
Condition: total_spend > byoyomi_duration
Formula:
  periods_consumed = floor(total_spend / byoyomi_duration)
  remaining_periods = current_periods - periods_consumed

Example:
  current_periods = 5
  byoyomi_duration = 30s
  total_spend = 92s
  
  periods_consumed = floor(92/30) = floor(3.06) = 3
  remaining_periods = 5 - 3 = 2
  
Status: Player in byo-yomi with 2 periods remaining
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Time Handling
```javascript
if (movingPlayer.isInByoYomi) {
  // Handle byo-yomi logic (cases 3.1 and 3.2)
} else {
  // Player in main time
  const newMainTime = Math.max(0, movingPlayer.timeRemaining - timeSpentOnMove);
  
  if (newMainTime > 0) {
    // Case 1: Still in main time
    movingPlayer.timeRemaining = newMainTime;
  } else {
    // Case 2: First time entering byo-yomi
    const timeOverage = timeSpentOnMove - movingPlayer.timeRemaining;
    const periodsConsumed = Math.floor(timeOverage / gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime);
    const remainingPeriods = Math.max(0, gameState.timeControl.byoYomiPeriods - periodsConsumed);
    
    if (remainingPeriods > 0) {
      movingPlayer.timeRemaining = 0;
      movingPlayer.isInByoYomi = true;
      movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft = remainingPeriods;
      movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
    } else {
      // Timeout - no periods left
      handlePlayerTimeout(gameState, movingPlayer);
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Byo-Yomi Period Handling
```javascript
if (movingPlayer.isInByoYomi) {
  if (timeSpentOnMove <= gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime) {
    // Case 3.1: Move within period - reset clock
    movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
    // Keep same period count
  } else {
    // Case 3.2: Move exceeded period(s) - calculate consumption
    const periodsConsumed = Math.floor(timeSpentOnMove / gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime);
    const newPeriodsLeft = Math.max(0, movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft - periodsConsumed);
    
    if (newPeriodsLeft > 0) {
      movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft = newPeriodsLeft;
      movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
    } else {
      // Timeout - consumed all remaining periods
      handlePlayerTimeout(gameState, movingPlayer);
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Byo-Yomi Entry
```
Setup: 7 periods √ó 30s each, 45s main time remaining
Move: Player spends 83s

Calculation:
- time_overage = 83 - 45 = 38s
- periods_consumed = floor(38/30) = 1
- remaining_periods = 7 - 1 = 6

Expected Result: Player in byo-yomi with 6 periods, clock at 30s
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Period Consumption
```
Setup: 5 periods √ó 30s each, already in byo-yomi
Move: Player spends 92s

Calculation:
- periods_consumed = floor(92/30) = 3
- remaining_periods = 5 - 3 = 2

Expected Result: Player in byo-yomi with 2 periods, clock at 30s
```

### Scenario 3: Move Within Period
```
Setup: 4 periods √ó 30s each, already in byo-yomi
Move: Player spends 15s

Calculation:
- 15 <= 30 ‚Üí Reset only
- periods remain = 4

Expected Result: Player in byo-yomi with 4 periods, clock reset to 30s
```

### Scenario 4: Timeout Cases
```
Setup: 2 periods √ó 30s each, already in byo-yomi
Move: Player spends 75s

Calculation:
- periods_consumed = floor(75/30) = 2
- remaining_periods = 2 - 2 = 0

Expected Result: Player times out (W+T or B+T)
```

## Logging Output

### Corrected Log Messages
```
üö® ENTERING BYO-YOMI: Player black spent 83s (38s over main time), consumed 1 periods, 6 periods remaining
‚è≥ BYO-YOMI PERIODS CONSUMED - Player black spent 92s, consumed 3 periods, 2 periods remaining  
üîÑ BYO-YOMI RESET - Player black made move in 15s (within period), period reset to 30s, periods remain: 4
üíÄ TIMEOUT - Player black consumed all byo-yomi periods (spent 75s, consumed 2 periods)
```

### Previous Incorrect Logs
```
üö® ENTERING BYO-YOMI: Player black entered byo-yomi with 7 periods  // WRONG - should be 6
‚è≥ BYO-YOMI PERIOD USED - Player black exceeded time, used one period  // WRONG - should be 3
```

## Performance Impact

### Accuracy Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Correct Period Calculation**: Periods consumed based on actual time spent
- ‚úÖ **Proper First Entry**: Correct periods remaining when entering byo-yomi
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Period Handling**: Can consume multiple periods in one move
- ‚úÖ **Edge Case Handling**: Proper timeout when all periods consumed

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Client-Side**: No changes needed - server sends correct period counts
- ‚úÖ **Existing Games**: New calculation applies to new moves only
- ‚úÖ **Network**: Same event structure, just correct values

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Test first byo-yomi entry with various time overages
- [ ] Test multiple period consumption in single move
- [ ] Test move within period (reset only)
- [ ] Test timeout scenarios
- [ ] Verify correct period counts displayed in UI

### Expected Behaviors
- [ ] Period counts decrease correctly based on time spent
- [ ] Clock always resets to full duration after move
- [ ] Timeouts occur when all periods consumed
- [ ] Logs show correct calculation details
