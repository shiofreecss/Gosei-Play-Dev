# Byo-Yomi Countdown Reset Fix ✅

## Issue Resolution: v1.0.9

**Status**: FIXED | **Date**: December 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - App breaking issue

## Problem Description

### The Issue
When Player A was in byo-yomi mode, the clock reset behavior was inconsistent:

1. **Step 1**: A plays, byo-yomi clock counts down → A finishes move → Clock resets (00:20 → 00:30) ✅
2. **Step 2**: B plays → A waits ✅  
3. **Step 3**: A plays, byo-yomi countdown → A finishes move → Clock DOES NOT reset ❌
   - Shows: "BY 5×00:12" (disabled)
4. **Step 4**: B plays → A waits ❌
5. **Step 5**: When A's turn enables → Clock resets "BY 5×00:12" → "BY 5×00:30" ❌

### Expected Behavior
The byo-yomi clock **MUST reset immediately** after A finishes their move, before the turn switches to B.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The issue was in the **timing of events** in `server/server.js`:

1. **Byo-yomi reset logic** was correct ✅
2. **Turn change timing** was delayed to allow client processing ❌
3. **Event emission** happened after turn change instead of immediately ❌

### Code Flow (Before Fix)
```javascript
// OLD FLOW - BROKEN
1. Player makes move
2. Server calculates time spent  
3. Server resets byo-yomi clock (correct)
4. Server sends timeUpdate event
5. Server waits 150ms for "client processing"
6. Server changes turn to other player
7. Server calls broadcastGameUpdate() 
8. broadcastGameUpdate() emits byoYomiReset event (TOO LATE!)
```

## Solution Implementation

### Fixed Event Flow
```javascript
// NEW FLOW - FIXED ✅
1. Player makes move
2. Server calculates time spent
3. Server resets byo-yomi clock (correct) 
4. Server IMMEDIATELY emits byoYomiReset event 🔧
5. Server sends timeUpdate event
6. Server changes turn immediately (no delay) 🔧
7. Server calls broadcastGameUpdate()
```

### Code Changes

#### 1. Immediate Byo-Yomi Reset Events
```javascript
// In makeMove handler
if (timeSpentOnMove <= movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft) {
  // Move made within byo-yomi time - RESET the byo-yomi period
  movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
  
  // CRITICAL FIX: Emit byoYomiReset event IMMEDIATELY when reset happens
  io.to(gameId).emit('byoYomiReset', {
    gameId,
    color: movingPlayer.color,
    byoYomiTimeLeft: movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft,
    byoYomiPeriodsLeft: movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft
  });
} else {
  // Time exceeded - consume a period and reset
  if (movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft > 1) {
    movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft -= 1;
    movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft = gameState.timeControl.byoYomiTime;
    
    // CRITICAL FIX: Also emit reset event when period is consumed
    io.to(gameId).emit('byoYomiReset', {
      gameId,
      color: movingPlayer.color, 
      byoYomiTimeLeft: movingPlayer.byoYomiTimeLeft,
      byoYomiPeriodsLeft: movingPlayer.byoYomiPeriodsLeft
    });
  }
}
```

#### 2. Removed Unnecessary Delay
```javascript
// OLD CODE - REMOVED
const needsByoYomiDelay = movingPlayer && movingPlayer.isInByoYomi;
if (needsByoYomiDelay) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    gameState.currentTurn = color === 'black' ? 'white' : 'black';
    broadcastGameUpdate(gameId, gameState);
  }, 150); // This delay was causing the problem!
}

// NEW CODE - IMMEDIATE
gameState.currentTurn = color === 'black' ? 'white' : 'black';
broadcastGameUpdate(gameId, gameState);
```

#### 3. Cleaned Up Redundant Events
```javascript
// Removed redundant byoYomiReset event from broadcastGameUpdate()
// Since we now emit it immediately when the reset happens
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Normal Byo-Yomi Reset
```
Given: Player A in byo-yomi with 30s period
When: A makes move in 15s
Then: Clock should immediately show 30s reset
And: Turn should change to B immediately
And: Clock should stay at 30s (not countdown)
```

### Test Case 2: Period Consumption and Reset  
```
Given: Player A in byo-yomi with 30s period
When: A makes move in 35s (exceeds period)
Then: Period count should decrease by 1
And: Clock should immediately reset to 30s
And: Turn should change to B immediately
```

### Test Case 3: Multiple Moves in Byo-Yomi
```
Given: Player A in byo-yomi
When: A makes move 1 → reset to 30s
And: B makes move
And: A makes move 2 → should reset to 30s immediately
Then: No delay or "disabled" state should occur
```

## Client-Side Compatibility

### GameTimer.js Updates
The client already handles the `byoYomiReset` event properly:

```javascript
const handleByoYomiReset = (data) => {
  const { color, byoYomiTimeLeft, byoYomiPeriodsLeft } = data;
  
  setPlayerTimes(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [color]: {
      ...prev[color],
      byoYomiTimeLeft: byoYomiTimeLeft,
      byoYomiPeriodsLeft: byoYomiPeriodsLeft,
      isInByoYomi: true,
      justReset: true // Visual feedback flag
    }
  }));
};
```

## Performance Impact

### Improvements
- ✅ **Reduced Latency**: No artificial 150ms delay
- ✅ **Better UX**: Immediate visual feedback
- ✅ **Cleaner Code**: Removed unnecessary complexity
- ✅ **More Reliable**: Events fire in correct order

### Network Efficiency
- **Same number of events** (no increase in traffic)
- **Better timing** (events fire when they should)
- **Reduced confusion** (no delayed/out-of-order events)

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing
1. Create game with byo-yomi (5 periods × 30s)
2. Let Player A run out of main time → enter byo-yomi
3. A makes move in byo-yomi → verify immediate reset
4. B makes move → A makes another move → verify immediate reset
5. Repeat multiple times to ensure consistency

### Expected Results
- ✅ Clock resets immediately after move completion
- ✅ No "disabled" or frozen clock states  
- ✅ Turn changes happen immediately
- ✅ Visual feedback is immediate and clear
- ✅ Period consumption works correctly

## Monitoring

### Server Logs to Watch
```
🔄 BYO-YOMI RESET - Player black made move in 15s, period reset to 30s
📤 BYO-YOMI RESET EVENT SENT - Player black: 30s, Periods=5
📤 TIME UPDATE SENT - Player black: InByoYomi=true, ByoYomiLeft=30s
```

### Client Logs to Watch
```
🔄 BYO-YOMI RESET for black: 30 seconds, 5 periods left
[UI] Byo-yomi reset animation triggered for black player
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these commits:
1. Immediate `byoYomiReset` event emission 
2. Removal of 150ms delay logic
3. Cleanup of redundant events

The old delay-based system can be restored by reverting the `server/server.js` changes.
