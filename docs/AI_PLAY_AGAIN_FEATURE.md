# AI Auto Play Again Feature

## âœ… Feature Complete!

When an AI game ends, the human player can start a new game instantly without waiting for AI confirmation.

## How It Works

### **Before Enhancement:**
- Game ends â†’ Human clicks "Play Again" â†’ Shows "Request Sent" â†’ Waits for AI response â†’ Creates new game

### **After Enhancement:**
- Game ends â†’ Human clicks "New AI Game" â†’ Shows "Starting New Game..." â†’ Instantly creates fresh game âœ…

## Implementation Details

### **Server-Side (`server/server.js`)**
1. **Auto-Detection**: Detects AI games in `playAgainRequest` handler
2. **Instant Processing**: When target player is AI, immediately creates new game
3. **AI Recreation**: Properly recreates AI player with same settings
4. **State Reset**: Resets undo usage (`aiUndoUsed = false`) for new game

```javascript
if (isAIGame && isTargetAI) {
  log(`ðŸ¤– AI game detected - auto-accepting play again request`);
  // Create new game immediately...
}
```

### **Client-Side (`GameCompleteModal.tsx`)**
1. **Smart UI**: Shows different states for AI vs human games
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Sets `waitingForNewGame` state for AI games
3. **Clear Messaging**: Button shows "New AI Game" instead of "Play Again"

```javascript
if (isAIGame) {
  setWaitingForNewGame(true); // Show loading immediately
} else {
  setPlayAgainRequestSent(true); // Show request sent for humans
}
```

## User Experience

### **AI Games:**
- Button shows: **"New AI Game"** âœ…
- Click â†’ **"Starting New Game..."** loading screen âœ…
- Instantly creates fresh game with same AI level âœ…
- No waiting for AI "response" âœ…

### **Human vs Human Games:**
- Button shows: **"Play Again"** (unchanged)
