Go Game Enhancement Recommendations
1. Territory Scoring Implementation
Current Status: The codebase has basic scoring states and dead stone marking capability, but lacks a comprehensive territory scoring algorithm.
Recommendation: Implement a full territory scoring system following either Chinese or Japanese rules.
Add functions to calculate territory ownership by flood-filling empty spaces
Count territory, prisoners, and komi for final score
Allow selection between Chinese and Japanese scoring rules

2. End Game Detection and Management
Current Status: The game has states for 'finished' and 'scoring', but lacks automated detection of game end conditions.
Recommendation: Implement proper end game detection:
Detect two consecutive passes to trigger scoring phase
Implement resignation functionality (partially exists but needs enhancement)
Create a complete game lifecycle with proper UI for each phase

3. Enhanced Handicap System
Current Status: Handicap stone placement is partially implemented but not fully integrated into gameplay.
Recommendation: Create a proper handicap system:
Better UI for handicap selection during game setup
Proper komi settings based on handicap
Automatic adjustment of first-player-turn based on handicap

4. Ko Rule Enhancement
Current Status: Basic ko rule checking exists but may not handle complex situations like superko.
Recommendation: Improve ko rule implementation:
Full superko rule implementation to prevent board position repetition
Better error messages and visualization for ko violations

5. Time Controls
Current Status: Time control is defined in game options but implementation appears incomplete.
Recommendation: Implement comprehensive time control features:
Game clock display
Different time control options (Byo-yomi, Fischer, etc.)
Visual and audible time warnings

6. Game Analysis Tools
Current Status: No post-game analysis tools visible in the codebase.
Recommendation: Add analysis features:
Move history browser with board state visualization
Heat maps showing territorial influence
Optional AI analysis integration
Game record export in SGF format

7. User Interface Improvements
Current Status: Basic functional UI exists but could be enhanced.
Recommendation: Add UI improvements:
Last move indicator (partially implemented)
Move number display
Captured stones counter display
Better mobile responsiveness for the game board

8. Tutorials and Learning Tools
Current Status: Limited guidance for new players.
Recommendation: Create learning resources:
Interactive tutorial mode
Problem solving (tsumego) mode
Basic strategy tips for beginners

9. Multiplayer Enhancements
Current Status: Basic multiplayer functionality exists with socket communication.
Recommendation: Improve multiplayer experience:
Spectator mode
Game invitations
Player profiles and rankings
Match history

10. Accessibility Improvements
Current Status: Limited accessibility features.
Recommendation: Enhance accessibility:
Keyboard navigation for the board
Screen reader compatibility
Color themes for color-blind players
Priority Recommendations
